Yes, it is possible to trigger a workflow in one GitHub project (repository) based on pushes or other events in a different GitHub project. However, GitHub does not support this directly within its native workflow triggers. Instead, you can set this up by using **webhooks** and **GitHub Actions with the repository dispatch event**.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

### 1. Set Up a Workflow in the Target Repository with `repository_dispatch`

In the **target repository** (the repository where you want the workflow to run), create a GitHub Actions workflow that is triggered by the `repository_dispatch` event.

#### Example Workflow (`.github/workflows/triggered-workflow.yml`):

```yaml
name: Triggered Workflow

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [trigger-from-other-repo]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run your task
        run: echo "Workflow triggered from another repository!"
```

- **`repository_dispatch`**: This event is used to trigger workflows externally.
- **`types`**: The `types` field specifies a custom event type (`trigger-from-other-repo` in this case), which you’ll use to trigger this workflow.

### 2. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

To securely trigger the workflow in the target repository from another repository, create a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** in GitHub with `repo` and `workflow` permissions.

1. Go to **GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens**.
2. Click **Generate New Token**, give it `repo` and `workflow` permissions, and copy the token.

### 3. Set Up a Webhook in the Source Repository

In the **source repository** (the one where the push occurs), create a workflow that sends a request to the target repository’s workflow with the `repository_dispatch` event.

#### Example Workflow in the Source Repository (`.github/workflows/webhook-trigger.yml`):

```yaml
name: Trigger Other Repository Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]  # or whichever branch should trigger the workflow

jobs:
  trigger-workflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Send dispatch event to target repository
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
          -H "Authorization: token $PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
          https://api.github.com/repos/target-owner/target-repo/dispatches \
          -d '{"event_type": "trigger-from-other-repo"}'
```

- **Replace `target-owner/target-repo`**: with the owner and repository name of the target repository.
- **`event_type`**: This should match the `repository_dispatch` type defined in the target repository’s workflow.
- **`PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`**: Use the PAT you created with `repo` and `workflow` permissions.

### 4. Store the Personal Access Token as a Secret

In the **source repository**, go to **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions** and add a new secret called `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the value of your PAT.

          https://api.github.com/repos/target-owner/target-repo/dispatches \
          -d '{"event_type": "trigger-from-other-repo"}'
```

### How This Works:
1. When you push to the source repository, the `webhook-trigger.yml` workflow runs.
2. It sends a `POST` request to the target repository’s dispatch endpoint, triggering the `repository_dispatch` event with the custom type `trigger-from-other-repo`.
3. The target repository’s `triggered-workflow.yml` workflow listens for this `repository_dispatch` event and starts its jobs.

This setup will allow a push in the source repository to trigger a workflow in the target repository securely and efficiently. Let me know if you need further assistance!
